# ✨ Day 5/100 - Results of Code Challenge ✨

## ☆.｡.:* 100 Days of Code Resumes! .｡.:*☆

Whewwww! After an intense few days of studying and preparing for my final code challenge for phase 2, I'm proud to annouce I PASSED!! In fact, the entire cohort passed the first round! I'm beyond joyed that we all get to go through the rest of the phase with no worries of having to re-test! Such a weight off my shoulders and an ease on my mind. 🥹
