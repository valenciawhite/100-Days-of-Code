# ✨ Day 4/100 -Preparations for Phase 2 Coding Challenge✨



## ☆.｡.:* “ By failing to prepare,  you are preparing to fail. ” .｡.:*☆

In preparations for my cohort's upcoming code challenge, our instructor proctored a mock code challenge for us to gauge our weak areas in React before the big day, Thursday. I chose not to do anything separate from working on course material today, as this challenge has taken precedence over any of my other side hobbies in coding. 

I spent today building and burning my code to work on my speed, and hopefully, this all pays off! Giving myself tons of encouragement as well as to my peers! I've gotten to work and study alongside some amazing people and to have the connection cut short would *not* be very fetch of us. 

Signing off,
