## â˜†.ï½¡.:* Feeling Depleted .ï½¡.:*â˜†

As the days pass, I feel more and more lost in my daily lectures. What's Day 3 on here, is actually closer to month 2 for me out there. My lectures are starting to feel like an endless game of catch-up and I'm growing frustrated trying to play along. Despite my low energy today, there's still a lining of hope within me that just won't let go. It's that little bit of faith that's keeping me going. I know in the end this process will all be worth it because nothing worth having comes easy. So they say, giving serious side-eye right now, lol. Even when I'm upset, I still can't help but chuckle just a bit. 

I'm starting to think writing these daily logs is less about the documentation of my coding progress and more about me just having a cathartic experience, where I have a place to whole-heartedly express all of me. This has been a grueling and beautiful experience all wrapped in one and to quit this early on is NOT an option. 

Let's make a toast, *raises my Key Lime LaCroix*. Let's toast to persevering when the road gets rockier and the light down the path seems dimmer than most days. 

My friend, there will be a means to an end. ðŸ’š

## â˜†.ï½¡.:* Creative JavaScript Projects .ï½¡.:*â˜†
To make a gloomy day much better, I thought it would be a great time to dive into a creative course I found from a YouTube ad. It's hilarious how well my ads know me. Once I saw the trailer, there was absolutely no hesitation between the site and my wallet ðŸ’€. The course is taught by Creative Developer 'Bruno Imbrizi' and hosted on Domestika, a similar platform to SkillShare. For the first project, the technology incorporated included **JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, Canvas Sketch, and Node.js**. I'm happy with how my pieces turned out. They're nowhere near what the instructor showcased, but that's the beauty of art. I'm sure Bob Ross would agree with me in the power of "Happy Accidents" :P.
