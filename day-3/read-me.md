## â˜†.ï½¡.:* Feeling Depleted .ï½¡.:*â˜†

As the days pass, I feel more and more lost in my daily lectures. What's Day 3 on here, is actually closer to month 2 for me out there. My lectures are starting to feel like an endless game of catch-up and I'm growing frustrated trying to play along. Despite my low energy today, there's still a lining of hope within me that just won't let go. It's that little bit of faith that's keeping me going. I know in the end this process will all be worth it because nothing worth having comes easy. So they say, giving serious side-eye right now, lol. Even when I'm upset, I still can't help but chuckle just a bit. 

I'm starting to think writing these daily logs is less about the documentation of my coding progress and more about me just having a cathartic experience, where I have a place to whole-heartedly express all of me. This has been a grueling and beautiful experience all wrapped in one and to quit this early on is NOT an option. 

Let's make a toast, *raises my Key Lime LaCroix*. Let's toast to persevering when the road gets rockier and the light down the path seems dimmer than most days. 

My friend, there will be a means to an end. ðŸ’š
