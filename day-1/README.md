# DAY 1/100 Of JavaScript/React Code Challenge

## Day 1 - React - useState + useEffect

## :sparkles: Prelude

If you made it to this repository, then you probably know a little bit about me, if so, then you know that I'm in a challenging 15-week full-stack web development program at Flatiron School. After having a hard time adjusting to the fast past curriculum and the influx of new information in such a short period, I, unfortunately, had to repeat Phase 1 of my program. To clarify, at Flatiron School there are 4 phases a budding developer has to go through and successfully pass to graduate.

At first glance, it would be too easy to take the news of having to repeat Phase 1 in misery, but due to my own spiritual beliefs, I'm pretty immune to news from the outside world and how I allow it to affect my sense of self-worth and mood internally. I took the news as a chance to learn even more this time around, and to be a helpful peer to those incoming into Phase 1 with fresh eyes.

And I did just that! Repeating Phase 1 helped me see how many gaps in my knowledge I truly had, and it was shocking! The second time around I was amazed at the ease and swiftness I took to JavaScript, which I couldn't dare fathom the first time around.

Now that I'm officially in Phase 2, woot woot! I've decided to try a different approach to how I go about consuming the material. Learning is all about trial and error and there's no way to avoid it. So why not go all out?

For Phase 2, I've decided to not only focus on the modules provided by Flatiron but also supplement my reading by building personal projects alongside the course material.

## :tea: Tea Time Was Born

To have something to show for at the end of this 100 days, I decided rather than scatter my energy into 100 vastly different topics, it would be best to channel that energy into one large project. Now how sternly I will stick to this...that's debatable. As I am as free-flowing as a blade of grass in a hurricane. But for now, that is where my mind is. And with that logic, I decided to build a mapping application for all my tea lovers out there, as finding speciality tea shops almost impossible. grrr...not for much longer my matcha-babes!

## :sparkles: Enter Phase 2 React.js Hooks

We've been learning about useState and useEffect and to be frank, it just wasn't clicking like I knew should be. Through the use of the readings my school provided and a couple of youtube videos later. I was able to implement both React Hooks in Tea Time. And once I got it, I was so excited! This is the joy that keeps me learning through material no matter how lost I feel.
